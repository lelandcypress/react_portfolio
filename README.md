## Description

I build out a collection of my best projects in an SPA using React.js. As you look through my colection of projects you will see my journey as a Full Stack Developer evolve from front end JS applications, integrating API calls, all the way to building various backend technologies; the projects I have highlighted best demonstrate this journey.
