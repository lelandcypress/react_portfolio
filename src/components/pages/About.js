          I am a Full Stack developer eager to develop high quality solutions
          through technology. I have many years of leadership experience, be it
          leading Marines or guiding my clients through challenging milestones.
          My background as a Project Manager has honed my communication and
          collaborative skills. I'm a graduate of a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp
          from Southern Methodist University, where I have learned and applied
          the MVC paradigm and OOP through JavaScript, Node, Express, and SQL.
          As a performance-driven leader, I am excited to use my technical
          skills and collaborative nature to help your team to continue to
          develop innovative, and exciting products.
