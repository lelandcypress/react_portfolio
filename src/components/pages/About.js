          I am a Full Stack developer eager to develop high quality solutions
          through technology. I have many years of leadership experience, be it
          leading Marines or guiding my clients through challenging milestones.
          My background as a Project Manager has honed my communication and
          collaborative skills. I am currently enrolled in Full Stack Coding
          Bootcamp from Southern Methodist University, where I have learned and
          applied the MVC paradigm and OOP through JavaScript, Node, Express,
          and SQL. As a performance-driven leader, I am excited to use my
          technical skills and collaborative nature to help your team to
          continue to develop innovative, and exciting products.
